# Finance

Finance is a stock trading app using non real funds, with live stock pricing data from the IEX API. This project was completed as part of Harvards CS50 course on Computer Science.

It was a nice project to tie together all the aspects of the tech stack that we had studied thus far and combining the mto make a full stack application.

## Tech Stack

- Flask
- SQL
- Jinja Templating Engine
- IEX API
